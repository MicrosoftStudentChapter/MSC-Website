A tremendous response was received from students, both from Thaparians and Non-Thaparians. There was a diverse participation of total 28 teams, of which 3 were all-girls teams, 8 were first year teams, 12 teams were from outside Thapar and 4 teams used GraphQL in their proposed solutions. From outside Thapar, Makeathon’19 had participation from Lovely Professional University, Maharaja Agrasen University, GMSSS 33, Saupin’s School, CGC College of Engineering. Of the 28 teams, 21 teams came forward for pitching.</div>

                     Microsoft Student Chapter, in collaboration with IntelleWings, is elated to present a 
                     solution to your quarantine blues, a Hackathon that's bound to electrify you to the 
                     core & leave you entranced in the end. This exquisite Hackathon has been named: 
                     "The War of Data Champions". The task at hand seems simple but requires grit and 
                     determination. Prepare a program which can scrape through government websites pages of 
                     different countries, and can make a database of all personal profiles of politically 
                     influential people. If you have what it takes then do consider becoming a part of this 
                     wave of innovation.

                    continue to address solutions that shape the future. And so MLSC came up with the Intra-
                    Society Ideathon, an exclusive MLSC's member-only event where they got to brainstorm
                    on some awesome ideas and present them in front of an amazing panel.
                    <br><br>
                    The theme for the event was Open-innovation so they were open to any real-life problems and 
                    had to provide tech driven solutions to it such as hardware, software, simulations, etc.
                    The purpose of the event was to give the members a taste of hackathon and also how to 
                    ace it. It also helped in building some great teams and friendships with peers.
                    The prerequisites were just a brain full of innovative ideas and no prior coding knowledge
                    was required. As they only had to present their ideas through a buisness model, ppts, and
                    the tech stack.
